# Robotics-Training
During this project, I was able to create a tinkercad model and make the motor move forward and backwards with given commands in my code. I used the materials 2 motors, 1 L293D Motor Driver, A potentiometer, Dip Switch and a 9V battery to create this. 
During this project, I built the circuit using the pinout given to me in the package. To create the code, I used the seminar given to me in the package to start the code off.
